Risk/Return Analysis and Predictions for 'MAG7' Stocks

Here I used pandas Dataframe to represent adjusted closing prices and compute moving averages, daily returns, and associated risk of 'MAG7' tech companies.
Created visual representations of comparative daily returns and single-stock analysis using Matplotlib, as well as more complex heatmaps and distribution plots using Seaborn.
Compared and plotted risk of investment between simple return analysis techniques and Monte-Carlo simulations.
